# Sleet

### FX organization

Sleet contains a library of effect "modules" - synth functions that is -
which are delivered in convenient formats for use in both NodeProxy
based code and as SynthDefs.

A design goal for this project was to make an effect library which was as easy to use in multi channel situations as in stereo and mono.

See the Sleet helpfile for examples and explanations.

This project is heavily inspired by the way [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt) is organized.
